## Introduction
To implement this system, we've decided to make use of a remote server to simulate a real case where, RabbitMQ and Redis
would be running in a remote server. To do so, we're using two docker containers, one for each, hosted at:
* Redis: 162.246.254.134:8001 (Requires no password)
* RabbitMQ: http://162.246.254.134:15672/
  * User: guest
  * Password: guest

Both containers are always running in detach mode, and containers aren't removed when stopped.<br>
Data in RabbitMQ is set to be kept even if there's a node failure to make sure that any message gets lost.
We've decided to make this implementation to have access to the same data and make a more realistic system.<br>
When it comes to the RPC implementation, we first started using XMLRPC, but ended implementing GRPC due to its safety and speed.
